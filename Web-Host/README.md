Hosts a server that clients can connect to it via a private network (ZeroTier recommended).

Clients can upload and download files to server host storage at high speed.

My download and upload speed was stable at around 50 mbps.

Files are saved in buffers. That means, if you send a 10gb file and cancel in midway, part of it will still be left on a server.

Files can only be removed from server host computer.

Use at your own risk!
